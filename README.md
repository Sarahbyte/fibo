# Fibo
Computes the first 40 fibonacci numbers in C.
$$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...$$

## How Does it Work?
As a base case, the first two numbers are 0 and 1 which are printed as they are.
Then, the next digit is the sum of the two previous digits.
$$a = 0, b = 1 \ a + b = 1 \\ a_{new} = b = 1, b_{new} = 1 $$
