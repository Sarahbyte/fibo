# Fibo
Computes the first 40 fibonacci numbers in C.
$$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...$$

## How Does it Work?
As a base case, the first two numbers are 0 and 1 which are printed as they are.
Then, the next digit is the sum of the two previous digits.
$$a_0 = 0 $$
$$a_1 = 1 $$
$$a_0 + a_1 = 1 $$
$$a_0 = a_1 = 1$$
$$a_1 = a_2 = 1 $$
$$and \ so \ on ...$$
